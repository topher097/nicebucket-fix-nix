# About

We got tired of using the AWS console and CLI to manage files in S3.
Sometimes you want a simple file browser that just works. So we built one.

## Features

- **Browse any S3-compatible bucket** (S3, R2, etc.) like local folders
- **Upload** files individually
- **Download** files individually
- **Create and delete** folders
- **Move** files between folders
- **Preview** files without downloading
- **Secure credential management** using your system's keyring

## Demo

Upload files to the root of a bucket or withing a folder and preview them within seconds.

Easily move files between folders.

## Installation

### Download

Download from the [Releases](https://github.com/nicebucket-org/nicebucket/releases) section.

#### Mac OS

We're currently working on adding code signing to our CI/CD. Unfortunately, Apple makes this process very cumbersome.
Until then, you need to run the following command in order to use nicebucket on Mac:

```
# Modify the path to the executable if required
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/nicebucket.app
```

#### Linux (Wayland)

Some non-Debian Wayland distributions require preloading the Wayland client library to launch the AppImage. We also had scaling glitches without `GDK_SCALE=1`, so keep it in the command below (adjust the binary name if needed):

```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so GDK_SCALE=1 ./nicebucket.AppImage
```

## Getting Started

1. Launch nicebucket
2. Add your S3/R2/custom credentials (Access Key ID + Secret Access Key)
3. Click any bucket to browse its contents

That's it. No complex configuration, no CLI commands to remember.

## Development

Want to contribute or run nicebucket locally? Here's what you need:

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (20+)
- [Tauri CLI](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/)

### Setup

Setup is quite simple: clone the repository, install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicebucket-org/nicebucket.git
cd nicebucket
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri
- **AWS Integration**: Rust AWS SDK
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui

We chose this stack because it lets us use our TypeScript knowledge while not having to use Electron.
Just kidding, we did not have prior experience so we just decided on Tauri because it sounded promising.
So far we're quite happy with the decision.

Built with ❤️ using Tauri, React and Tailwind.
